# Discrete Output Menu Control

Early design of PicoPonics will Allocate 13 pins for direct device control
meaning that the output from those pins will be a 1:1 correlation for the
signal that is controlling a device.

Discrete On or Off and nothing in between, working on a timer.

I think in later designs I'll change this, but in Mk1 that's how it will be.


## Menu Cursor Handling
At any given point, the menu should have an active list of cursor selections.

### 10000 is root level mode of output menu.
